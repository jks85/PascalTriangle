### Project Description

The main purpose of this project is to generate binomial coefficients, or values from
Pascal's triangle. The repo contains four files:

1. Pascal.py
2. PrintingTriangles.py
3. Testing.py
4. Analysis.txt


### Description of Files

#### Pascal
- "slow" function for computing binomial coefficients
  - *get_binom_coeff*
- "fast" function for computing binomial coefficients
  - *fast_binom_coeff*


#### PrintingTriangles
- functions for printing lines of Pascal's triangle
- functions for "pretty" printing lines of Pascal's triangle
- pretty printing is not yet functional

#### Testing
- code for functions used to test time effiency of functions in Pascal.py
- also contains results (commented out)

#### Analysis
- Write up comparing efficiency of *get_binom_coeff* and *fast_binom_coeff*
